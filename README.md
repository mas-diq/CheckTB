    Tuberculosis, often known as TB, is caused by the bacterium called Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis). It is an infectious disease. In this study, an android-based expert system was designed to diagnose Tuberculosis. Diagnosis using this system is expected to be able to detect Tuberculosis early so that treatment can be carried out faster to prevent the possibility of a worse condition occurring. In this study, the method used is the certainty factor method. This method is used to prove whether a fact is certain or uncertain in the form of metrics. The results of the consultation test obtained from this system indicate that the system can detect Tuberculosis based on the symptoms experienced by the user, which is processed using specific rules based on the existing knowledge base.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Ideas Behind The Project :bulb:
<p align="justify">
Indonesia is a country with the third highest burden of tuberculosis (TB) after India and China, with a population of more than 1 billion (WHO, 2021). Currently, Indonesia is one of eight countries that contributes 2/3 of TB cases in the world, while the number of TB cases treated and reported to SITB in 2021 is 356,957 cases with detection and treatment coverage (treatment coverage) of 43% (target: 85%) (WHO, 2021). Problems related to the uncertainty aspect of the user's answer that can impact the diagnosis results can be overcome by applying the certainty factor (CF) method. According to Ayu, P et al. (2021), the Certainty Factor method is a method that defines a measure of certainty to a fact or rule to describe the level of expert confidence in the problem at hand, using the Certainty Factor can describe the level of expert confidence in a disease. The certainty factor expresses confidence in an event (fact or hypothesis) based on evidence or expert judgment.
